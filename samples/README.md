Copy into the CECTool/import/streetpasses folder on the sd card.

Create the directory if required and copy the folder(s) that correspond to the titles you wish to import streetpasses from.

All passes are extracted from the spreadsheet here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A3IReJh9cj-5kTgkFHW_oZ-WLg2Oz79gr-MiMXVhJmU/edit#gid=0

After using disa-extract on each archive, the size was around 1gb. After extracting just the inbox and outbox messages, the size is down to 11mb. Not bad.

What ends up being copied over during streetpass transmission, is the outbox message gets transferred into the inbox of the other, and vice-versa.
The mbox timestamp received is updated, and the inbox boxinfo is updated with the message header info.
